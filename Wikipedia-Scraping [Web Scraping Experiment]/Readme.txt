Objective : to design a python code which would take user input and fetch the data for it from Wikipedia and save it in the local storage, using Web Scraping toos.

Script by : Vishwesh Deore [ https://github.com/VishweshDeore ]

Wikipedia is a widely known website populalry used for understaning topics and terms in short and get details about anything one wants to know about. 
After checking the website structures and url formats I tried two methods to achieve the above mentioned objective

Two methods are used in the code file, both of which provide a slithly different output. The code is still being worked on to improve the output. 

1. The first method used is by implementing BeautifulSoup 
 
2. The second method used consists of a function from the inscriptis package

# Inscriptis used from github project of  : (github id : weblyzard , https://github.com/weblyzard/inscriptis)
